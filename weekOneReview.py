#1 Print your name to the console!


#2 Ask for a user's birthday year and return how old they will turn this year.


#3 Write a short program that asks the name of the user.  If they write in all caps, thank them for their enthusiasm.  Otherwise, ask them to speak louder next time.

#5 Write a function that takes in three numbers and tells the user which one is the largest.



#6 Write a function that takes in the per-person cost of breakfast and the per-person cost of lunch, and then calculates the cost of all food for the three-week FinTech program.



#7 Here is a list (which you will un-comment):
#classesInHighSchool = ["Algebra", "French", "Physics", "Global History", "Gym", "English", "Biology", "Band"]
# Add another course at the end of the list.  Print your new list.
# Let's say you didn't take French in high school.  Replace French with a class you did take.  Print your new list.
# Alphabetize the list.  Print your new list.
